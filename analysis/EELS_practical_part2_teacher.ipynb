    "\n",
    "## EELS statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The EELS processes are Poissonian in nature (see *EELS: EGERTON, Ray F. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy in the electron microscope. Springer Science & Business Media, 2011.*). Indeed, we observe a flow of electron over a given period of time and the inelastic scattering events are (in a good approximation) statistically independant from each other. It is often referred as shot noise.\n",

    "\n",
    "### CCD detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of the statistical noise of the CCD is given by the following formula : \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Var(J(E)) \\approx g + p J(E) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $J(E)$ is the detected electron current, following a Poisson statistics. $p$ is a conversion proportionality constant and $g$ is an additive gaussian noise originating from read-out noise and dark current. The variance is not constant over the channels of the detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The direct electron detectors are mostly limited by shot noise, thus the noise variance becomes : \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Var(J(E)) \\approx p J(E) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The absence of dark noise ($g$) drastically improve the performances of these detectors (especially at low doses). The variance is still not constant over the channels of the detectors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for data analysis or for denoising of multidimensional data. It is based on statistical principles and it is used in a wide variety of domains from text analysis to meteorology and STEM-EELS is no exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "The data below are represented using two main axes, x and y. Each of those axes correspond to some variance of the data as it can be seen in the projection of the data on those axes (thick redlines). \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/random_data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The PCA will reorganise the axes on which the data are represented. The axes are rotated so that they correspond to gradually decreasing variance of the data. It means that the first axis (arrow parallel the line) is represents the highest variance in the data (Thick blue line) and the second axis (arrow perpendicular to the line) represents lower variance (thick green line). \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/random_data_PCA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data analysis, this reorganisation of the axes is useful. With the new representation we easily get that the main feature of the signal is the straight line and that the axis perpendicular to it represents mainly noise. **In general, after PCA you should determine which are the relevant axes (or components) describing your signal and discard the noisy ones.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The impact of noise statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the data presented just above, the STEM-EELS data are heteroscedastic. The reorganisation of the axes will not occur in the same way. Therefore, a correction of this effect is required. That is also why it is important to understand the statistics of the data you analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/poisson_data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Increasing the dimension of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The PCA principles apply even with data of higher dimension. For spectrum images, they can be represented as a collection of spectra (N pixels spectra). A point in 2D space corresponds to 2 coordinates (x,y). A point in 3D space corresponds to 3 coordinates (x,y,z). A spectrum can be seen as a point in E-dimensional space ($I_1, I_2, ..., I_E$).\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/flat_spim.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is going to decompose the data in two matrices. The first matricx called factors contains the vectors of the new representation, each column contains one spectrum-like axis. Each row of the second matrix (called loadings) correspond to the intensity of a given axis of the new representation. In the previous part with the line, the first line of the loadings will give out where each point is on the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/decomposition.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a spectral signature with high variance (such as the zero-loss peak) will have it's own axis in the new representation. Thus, there will be a corresponding loading describing the spatial evolution of the zero-loss peak intensity."

    "The Non-Negative Matrix Factorization is somewhat similar to PCA. It decomposes the data into factors and loadings, although they are not organized according to decreasing variance. The main difference is that the factors and loadings are constrained to positive values. \n",
    "\n",
    "We activate the NMF using the keyword argument `algorithm = 'NMF'`. It is an iterative algorithm and the calculation is much longer. That is why, We limit beforehand the number of components using the keyword argument `output_dimension = n`, where `n` is the integer you choose. The algorithm might not converge with the default amount of iterations, you can use `max_iter=` to increase it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The PCA modifies the spim object. It is recommended to reload the data before performing NMF.**\n",
    "\n",
    "⭐ Hyperspy has a flexible enough interface. You can use many different decomposition algorithms such as the ones of scikit-learn with more or less the same syntax. For example, the value of `algorithm=` can be any object that implements the `fit` and `transform` methods."
