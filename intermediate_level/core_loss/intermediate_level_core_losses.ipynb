    "- Model fitting\n",

    "# üè† Installing Hyperspy with anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is intended to help you to install hyperspy on your own computer in your own lab. **You can skip this part for the practical.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is python package manager dedicated to science. Using Anaconda it is possible to create virtual environments. You can then manage different virtual environments to isolate different distributions of python packages. This way you can keep stable python distributions safe from unstable ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "We describe here the few steps required to create an environment with Hyperspy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üè† Install Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your operating system install anaconda : https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, launch the Anaconda Prompt, a console should appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üè† Create a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the command : ```conda create --name myenv``` (change \"myenv\" by any name you like.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your virtual environment is created but you're still in the default one called \"base\". You need to activate it by typing: ```conda activate myenv```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üè† Installing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "When installing a package there are two solutions: \n",
    "1. Either it is part of the already available libraries \n",
    "2. Either you can access it from anaconda forge\n",
    "\n",
    "(1). Run the command : ```conda install package-name``` with for example: ```conda install scikit-learn```\n",
    "\n",
    "(2). The available python packages are listed on : https://anaconda.org/ . After searching for the library you want, you can click on its name in bold. There will be a list of commands to type and execute to install the selected package. For Hyperspy it is: ```conda install -c conda-forge hyperspy```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üè† installing ipython\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few steps will enable you to run the virtual environment you created in ipython notebooks. In the Anaconda prompt run the following commands :\n",
    "- ```conda install jupyter```\n",
    "- ```conda install ipykernels```\n",
    "- ```python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can start the ipython notebook environment using: ```jupyter notebook```. You will be able to create ipython notebooks (top right corner) with the virtual environments you want. All the packages installed (and their versions) will be specific to that environment. "
